# Xpression Hook info
I am locating the file for providing the reverse geocoded location back to Xpression at \\CALL-xpn-mosgw\C:\XXXXXXXXXX_CG_Payloads\Local_KGAN_Locator\
It's shared via \\CALL-XPN-MOSGW\Local_KGAN_Locator\

Optional Color State:
The VM must have access to \\CALL-xpn-mosgw\C:\XXXXXXXXXX_CG_Payloads\2018_Look (not a validpath, just illuistrating where it needs to be)
I shared it via \\CALL-XPN-MOSGW\2018_Look access it using the Kiosk account info.

This file defines the color state of the graphics and is used to determine the color state of our stuff if needed.
